    # This workflow auto-deploys Supabase migrations to production.
    #
    # When it runs:
    # - Triggers after the CI workflow completes on the main branch
    # - Only proceeds if CI passed (workflow_run.conclusion == 'success')
    # - Only proceeds if it was a 'push' event (not a PR)
    #
    # Why check for 'push'?
    # - PRs to main trigger CI but shouldn't deploy migrations
    # - When a PR is merged, GitHub fires a 'push' event to main
    # - Since main is protected, direct pushes aren't allowed anyway
    # - So 'push' effectively means "a PR was just merged"
    #
    # The workflow also checks if any migration files changed before
    # running supabase db push, to avoid unnecessary deployments.
