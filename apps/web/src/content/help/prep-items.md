# Adding and Completing Prep Items

Prep items are the individual tasks that need to be completed at each station. This guide covers how to add, manage, and track prep items.

## Adding Prep Items

1. Navigate to a station in your kitchen
2. Click the **Add Item** button or use the input field
3. Enter the item name (e.g., "Dice onions", "Make hollandaise")
4. Optionally add a quantity and unit
5. Press Enter or click Add

### Quick Tips

- **Be specific** - "Dice 5 lbs yellow onions" is better than "Onions"
- **Use consistent naming** - Your team will learn to recognize items faster
- **Include quantities** - Helps with planning and accountability

## Managing Prep Items

### Marking Items Complete

- Click the checkbox next to an item to mark it complete
- Click again to unmark if needed
- Progress is tracked automatically

### Editing Items

1. Click on the item name to edit
2. Make your changes
3. Click save or press Enter

### Deleting Items

1. Click the delete icon on the item
2. Confirm the deletion

## Tracking Progress

The station view shows your progress:

- **Progress bar** - Visual indicator of completion percentage
- **Counts** - Number of completed items vs total
- **Real-time updates** - See your team's progress live

## Copying from Previous Days

If you have similar prep each day:

1. Click the **Copy Recent** button
2. Select items from a previous day
3. Choose which items to copy
4. Items are added to today's list

This saves time when your prep list is consistent day-to-day.
