# Creating and Managing Stations

Stations represent the different work areas in your kitchen. They help organize prep items by location or function.

## What is a Station?

A station is a work area where prep happens. Common examples include:

- **Hot Line** - Sauces, proteins, finishing items
- **Cold Side** - Salads, cold apps, garnishes
- **Pastry** - Desserts, baked goods, bread
- **Prep** - Mise en place, vegetable prep
- **Grill** - Grilled items and proteins

## Creating a Station

1. Navigate to your kitchen dashboard
2. Click the **Add Station** button
3. Enter a name for the station
4. The station will appear in your list immediately

## Managing Stations

### Reordering Stations

Stations appear in the order they were created. To change the order, you can rename stations to include numbers (e.g., "1. Hot Line", "2. Cold Side").

### Editing a Station

1. Go to your kitchen settings
2. Find the station in the **Stations** tab
3. Click the edit icon to rename
4. Click save to confirm changes

### Deleting a Station

1. Go to your kitchen settings
2. Find the station in the **Stations** tab
3. Click the delete icon
4. Confirm the deletion

**Warning:** Deleting a station will also delete all prep items associated with it.

## Best Practices

- **Keep it simple** - Use clear, recognizable names your team already uses
- **Match your physical layout** - Name stations to match actual kitchen areas
- **Consider workflow** - Order stations in the sequence your team works
