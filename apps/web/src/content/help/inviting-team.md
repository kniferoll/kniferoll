# Inviting Team Members

Collaborate with your kitchen team by inviting them to join your kitchen in Kniferoll.

## How Invites Work

1. You create an invite link for your kitchen
2. Share the link with team members
3. They click the link and join your kitchen
4. They can now view and update prep items

## Creating an Invite Link

1. Go to your kitchen dashboard
2. Click the **Invite** button
3. A unique invite link is generated
4. Copy the link or share it directly

### Invite Link Options

- **QR Code** - Display a QR code team members can scan
- **Copy Link** - Copy the invite URL to share via text or email
- **Expiration** - Links expire after 7 days for security

## Anonymous vs Registered Users

### Anonymous Users

Team members can join without creating an account:

- They choose a display name when joining
- Access is tied to their device
- Perfect for cooks who just need to check off prep

### Registered Users

Team members with accounts get:

- Access from any device
- Role persistence across kitchens
- Ability to own their own kitchens (Pro plan)

## Managing Team Members

Once someone joins, you can manage their access:

1. Go to your kitchen settings
2. Select the **Members** tab
3. View all current members and their roles
4. Remove members if needed

## Revoking Access

To remove someone from your kitchen:

1. Go to kitchen settings > Members
2. Find the team member
3. Click the remove button
4. Confirm the removal

They will no longer be able to access the kitchen or its prep lists.
